This is 1 of my previous mini projects that implements direct credit card charging via Stripe API. It was foked from https://github.com/stripe/stripe-php. The work includes making UI that lets merchant create customers and charge them by their credit card details, building the feature that enables switching between different Stripe live or test account(s), as well as logging the charge history.

It could be previewed and demonstrated in person. Below is the picture of the interface for reference:
